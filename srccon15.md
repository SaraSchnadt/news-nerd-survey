On June 26, Scott and Brian led a session at srccon in Minneapolis and asked people to submit five things they wanted to know about the community. What follows is what people who attended the session wrote. 

- Seniority within organization (entry level, exec, middle management)
- How long has your job description existed?
- Are you a full-time employee?
- Job descriptions
- Are you having an identity crisis? (i.e., are you clear about what your purpose is at work day-to-day?)
- Are you happy?
